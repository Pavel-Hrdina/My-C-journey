# My C journey

The folder are structured to three sections: notes, question and code. Folders that don't contain code, don't have and exercise in the chapter. The question folder also contains a folder with answers

This repository contains my journey with the c programming language. I am putting the code and the notes into separate directories. To make it easier to understand and read later on.

It is important to make sure that **the repository remains structured and clean** Folder name is the name of the chapter in the book _[The GNU C Programming Tutorial](http://www.crasseux.com/books/ctut.pdf)_. Each folder contains the notes from the chapter and the code that I wrote and played with.

**The code has comments** so that I know how each concept and tool works when I go through it after.

I also try my best to **not blow my foot off** while writing the code, so it should be safe to run, on your computer, if you chose to do so.

I also try my best to follow [these](https://micrium.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/osiidoc/pages/163859/C+Coding+Conventions) coding conventions when possible.
