# Questions for Chapter 6

1. What is a global variable?

2. What is a local variable?
   
3. Do parameters spoil functions by leaking the variables into other functions?
   
4. Write a program gnoahs_park that declares 4 variables. Two global integer variables called num_gnus and num_gnats, and two local floating point variables within the func-
tion main, called avg_gnu_mass, and avg_gnat_mass. Then add another function
called calculate_park_biomass, and pass avg_gnu_mass and avg_gnat_mass to it.
How many different storage spaces are used when this program runs? (Hint: are avg_
gnu_mass and avg_gnat_mass and their copies the same?)
