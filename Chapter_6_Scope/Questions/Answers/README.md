# Answers for chapter 6

1. What is a global variable?

    A variable that can be seen every time its called.

2. What is a local variable?
   
   A variable only available to the function that is declared in.

3. Do parameters spoil functions by leaking the variables into other functions?
   
   Yes, they do, and they also don't.

4. Write a program gnoahs_park that declares 4 variables. Two global integer variables called num_gnus and num_gnats, and two local floating point variables within the function main, called avg_gnu_mass, and avg_gnat_mass. Then add another function called calculate_park_biomass, and pass avg_gnu_mass and avg_gnat_mass to it. How many different storage spaces are used when this program runs? (Hint: are avg_gnu_mass and avg_gnat_mass and their copies the same?)
